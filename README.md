This project is designed for Formula One fans like myself with the goal of providing a simple yet challenging memory game with a user friendly design, the game will always lay out the cards differently aswell as providing a user score, giving the users a reason to comeback to the site and keep playing multiple games.

## UX

### User Goals

I expect that the majority of the users will fall into the following criteria:

- Be a Forumula One Fan
- A user looking for a time waster
- A user looking for a challenging memory challenge

### User Stories

- As a user, I want the site to simple to use and visually appealing.
- As a user, I want the cards to be shuffled everytime I play it.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how well I am playing the game (Score).
- As a user, I want instructions on how to play the game.
- As a user, I want to have fun!.
